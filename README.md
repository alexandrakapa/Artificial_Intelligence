# Artificial_Intelligence

Project on Artificial Intelligence for the 2021-2022 course at NTUA ECE. All projects have been implemented using Python.

* First project:\
We implemented the Randomized Prim algorithm in order to solve random mazes. Then, we implemented several search algorithms such as Best First, Dijkstra and A* using different distance metrics (Manhattan, Euclidean, Chebyshev, Octile). Lastly, we proposed a number of mazes that follow specific criteria.

* Second project:\
We implemented a movie recommendation system. First of all we constructed our knowledge base and then defined prolog rules in order to compute movie recommendetions.

* Third project:\
We implemented the following machine learning classifiers: KNN, Naive Bayes, Multi-Layer perceptron in order to classify music songs to specific classes.
